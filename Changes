    [THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]

    - Removed 'get_location()' as an alias. Please use the more specific 'get_current_url()' instead.
      It's a more specific name that matches the Selenium API method name.

    [NEW FEATURES]

    - Added and started using Test::WebDriver::WebElement. This a sub-class of
      Selenium::Remote::Driver::WebElement. This allows testing methods on
      the "WebElement" object as well as main '$driver' object.

      Requires at least Selenium::Remote::Driver 0.18 to work.

    [INTERNALS]
    
    - Removed remaining "Glue Code" methods. They were merged into the parent class,
      so they no longer need to repeated here. (Mark Stosberg)
