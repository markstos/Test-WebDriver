    [THINGS THAT MIGHT BREAK YOUR CODE]

    - Removed 'get_location()' as an alias. Please use the more specific 'get_current_url()' instead.
      It's a more specific name that matches the Selenium API method name.

    [NEW FEATURES]

    - Added and started using Test::WebDriver::WebElement. This a sub-class of
      Selenium::Remote::Driver::WebElement. This allows testing methods on
      the "WebElement" object as well as main '$driver' object.

      Requires at least Selenium::Remote::Driver 0.18 to work.

    - Adding test checking methods:

        # Run regex's against the entire page source
        content_like()
        content_unlike()

        # Run regex's against just the "text" of the page
        text_like()
        text_unlike()

      The names are intentionally the same as their Test::WWW::Mechanize
      counterparts.  However, these methods may take an arrayref of regular
      expressions for improved performance when you want to run multiple tests
      against the same page.

      Normally Selenium::Remote::Driver would make an HTTP request to the
      driven browser for each content check. By using an arrayref for multiple
      checks of the same page, you can avoid the extra HTTP requests
      and speed up your tests. (Mark Stosberg)


    [INTERNALS]
    - Added Test::LongString as a dependency to support the new content checking methods.
    
    - Removed remaining "Glue Code" methods. They were merged into the parent class,
      so they no longer need to repeated here. (Mark Stosberg)
