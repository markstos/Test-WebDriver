    - Removed 'get_location()' as an alias. Please use the more specific 'get_current_url()' instead.
      It's a more specific name that matches the Selenium API method name.

    - Removed remaining "Glue Code" methods. They were merged into the parent class,
      so they no longer need to repeated here. (Mark Stosberg)
